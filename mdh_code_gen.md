# Code Generation
We generate executable program code from MDHâ€™s low-level program representation.

**Currently Supported Target Programming Models:**
- [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org) (for CPUs)
- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (for NVIDIA GPUs)
- [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) (for multiple kinds of architectures)
